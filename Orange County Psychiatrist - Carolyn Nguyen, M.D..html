        Dr. Carolyn Nguyen does not accept Medi-Cal or Medicare and is not on 
        any insurance panels. However, she is considered an <strong>out-of-network</strong> 
        physician for PPO insurance plans and can provide you with a "superbill" 
        statement that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement 
        of a portion of your paid fee (varies from 20% to 90% reimbursement). 
        Please contact your insurance company for details on whether they reimburse 
        policy holders for out-of-pocket payment for the following psychiatric 
        services codes rendered by noncontracted providers: <strong>90792</strong> 
        (initial psychiatric consultation); <strong>99214</strong> (evaluation 
        and ~EM~ - moderate); <strong>+90833</strong> (30 min psychotherapy w/EM);

      <p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Dr. Carolyn Nguyen wants to provide 
        high-quality services that are tailored to your individual circumstances 
        and personal needs, rather than based on an insurance company's demands 
        and restrictions upon the time and frequency she spends on your care. 
        Elimination of paperwork and hours on the phone with insurance companies 
        allows her to spend more quality time with you.</font></p>
